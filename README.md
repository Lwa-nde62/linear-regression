# linear-regression

## Description
This project implements a simple linear regression model using the Rust programming language and the Burn library. The goal of the model is to predict the output of the equation y = 2x + 1 using synthetic data for training, with added noise to simulate real-world conditions.

Objective:
Implement a linear regression model in Rust using the Burn library.
Use synthetic data to train the model and predict values based on y = 2x + 1.
Evaluate the model's performance and visualize the results.

## Steps to Set Up
# Setting Up the Project in GitHub Codespaces
# 1. Open GitHub Repository:
Visit the repository URL: GitHub Repository.
Click on the Code button and select Open with Codespaces.
Choose New codespace and wait for the environment to initialize.

# 2. Install Rust:
In the terminal of GitHub Codespaces, run the following command to install Rust:
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

Once the installation completes, verify it by checking the version of Rust:
rustc --version

## Challlenge
Firstly, I had a problem with the Applications not running after installation; I ended up finding alternatives on how to approach the problem online without having to install applications on my local machine. I then used GitHub Codespaces to approach the problem. However, I still had challenges when trying to run the code it would give an error message that cargo does not exist even though I did install it.

## Reflection
As I was not familiar with Rust, AI and other resources really help me to understand the language I'm working with. It helped me to learn a little about it and what was needed on the project using this programming language.

However, I could not solve the problem, due to challenges I have faced while trying to solve the problem. From this experience, Ihave learned that I should do a research first, especially if I'm working with something that I'm not familiar with and that I should start the project on that in order to have time to solve it successfully.
